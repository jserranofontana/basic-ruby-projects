## Assignment
Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldnâ€™t it?).

    bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
    => [0,2,2,3,4,78]

## What I used
> Adapted from the bubble sort algorith in wikipedia

Ruby loops (mainly **while** and **for** method)

## What I learned
How to use loops. 

Traverse through the elements of an array and swap elements.
